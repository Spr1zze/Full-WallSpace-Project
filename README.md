# WallSpace

WallSpace is a student learning project — a simple chat system designed to connect people from all over the world. Built as part of a software engineering course, it explores core web and backend concepts to enable communication between users.

## 🌍 Purpose

WallSpace addresses the common issue of losing touch with loved ones by providing a basic platform for online communication.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: C# (OOP concepts), SignalR  
- **Other**: API communication, database integration

## 📦 Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/Spr1zze/Full-WallSpace-Project
2. Open the project folder in your preferred editor (e.g., VS Code).
3. Use any live server or hosting extension to run the frontend locally.

> Note: The backend must also be configured to test chat functionality. The project is still under development.

## 🚀 Usage

Currently, the system is only functional when hosted locally. You can open the HTML files in a live server environment to test layout and UI features.

Due to the unfinished state, only local testing is possible — true peer-to-peer chatting is not available yet.

## ✨ Features

- Add friends  
- Send messages  
- Basic communication interface  

## ⚠️ Limitations

This project is under development with no final release planned yet. Limitations include:

- No working peer-to-peer (P2P) chat — local-only testing
- No live backend hosting
- Features may be incomplete or non-functional
